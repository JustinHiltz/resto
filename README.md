###My Restaurant Website

I'm always bothered by how difficult it is to navigate restaurant websites when walking down the street looking for somewhere good to eat. It's frustrating when you just want to take a quick look at a menu and you're hit with a PDF or non-responsive website.


This is where I'm trying a few ideas to make friendly and easy to use restaurant websites.
